I am currently an undergraduate at International University - VNUHCM (2018-expected graduation 2022), majoring in Computer Science. Before that, I studied high school at [PTNK](http://www.ptnk.edu.vn/). During my study, I developed applications such as websites and wrote scripts such as the TFT auto bot. I have been studying and practicing Data Science on the Kaggle platform since 2020 (I am a Kaggle discussion expert and earned some Specialization certificates on Coursera). Recently, I switch my focus to researching Machine Learning methods that are practical for low-resource communities under the guidance of postdocs and professors from CMU.

I joined FPT Software HCM as a Data Engineer/Analyst after the internship period. My job focuses around Snowflake, AWS, Airflow and MicroStrategy. I am also invited to join a project about Data Synthesis from FPT AI Center.

Sometimes I write (shitpost) blogs [link](https://minhlong94.github.io/blog/).

# Fun Fact
I am a hardcore gamer.
